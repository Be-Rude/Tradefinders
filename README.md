## User Experience

The user will be able to search for categorized trade types and/or locations. They can then navigate through the application and view the various search results meeting that criteria and view the company profiles.

Within the company profiles the user can see reviews and ratings. The average rating system is based on 4 main criterias: Cleanliness, Reliability, Value and Workmanship. Reviews can be added by clicking "add review" within the company profile view.

The user can also request a quotation by completing the quotation form.

If a company wishes to list their business on the website, they can do so by completing the form by clicking on the Add Company button in the navigation panel.
